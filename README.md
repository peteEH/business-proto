## Introduction

A PCB Business Card that doubles as a handy prototyping tool!

- Haven't you always looked around, wished you had one more 'stripboard' or 'perf board' for that circuit you're dreaming up or debugging? This business card might just save the day! And who knows, maybe it'll lead to a future collaboration.
## Assembly? No Assembly Required

- It's a blank canvas!

## Features

- **Signal/Power holes**: 0.1" pitch
  - 21 - columns of power/ground - 2 rows top/bottom  (21 x 2 x 2)
  - 19 - signal columns  (19 x 6 x 2)
  - there's a convenient "grounding" strip along the center for tying any signal colums to ground with a simple solder short.
- **Power Options:** USB Type-C and/or USB Micro-B Power Support or external pins for VCC with reverse polarity support
- **Decoupling Capacitors**: distributed throughout
- **On-board IC Breakout** (space limited)
  - 1 x SOIC-8 op-amp
  - 1 x 3x2.5mm (+/-) oscillator
  - 1 x SOT-23 linear regulator, optional tie in with VCC strips.
